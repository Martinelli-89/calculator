 <h2> Calculator requirements and functionality </h2>
 <h4>You only need a browser to use the calculator.<br> Before performing any operation the calculator needs to be turned on using the on/off button.
 <br>The calculator can perform consecutives operation if needed and has a button to change the look of it.
 <br> I should have stopped any possibility for the user to make the calculator stop working so, if you manage to break it, please let me know so I can fix the code :) .</h4>

 <h2> Extra <h2>
